FOXDOT:
sometimes takes multiple executions to play...
p1 >> pluck(PRange(5) | PRange(5,0,-1), scale=Scale.default.pentatonic)

ctrl-enter is supercollider and foxdot command to run
so using ctrl+enter for AREPL run block command makes sense

need command for stopping sound

MARKETING:
I made a VSCode extension that lets you see your variables while you write your code. Any feedback?
